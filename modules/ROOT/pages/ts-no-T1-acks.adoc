= I do not receive TA1 acknowledgments for my transmissions.

Anypoint Partner Manager sends TA1 ack’s back for any received transmission, if configured to do so.

== Cause

In case you are not receiving TA1 configurations, please review the following configuration.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production) select *Partners* and Receive from <Partner_Name>.

. Scroll to Validation and Acknowledgment settings and click *X12*.

. Within the Acknowledgements section ensure that the option for ‘Send TA1 for each transmission from <partner name>’ is selected.

. Configure the Acknowledgement endpoint as in xref:endpoints.adoc[Endpoints]

. Click *Save* when done.

This enables TA1 acknowledgments for all transmissions received by the specific partner.
