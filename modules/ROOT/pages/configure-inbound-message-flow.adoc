When receiving a B2B message from your partner In some cases, your trading partner may send you more than one URL, a Receiving URL and a URL for receiving asynchronous MDNs. If this is the case, you only need to configure the Receiving URL; if a separate URL is needed to return MDNs to, it will be sent in the AS2 transmission and Partner Manager will read it from there.

Note: Even after you have changed your personal profile settings, the receiving URL for the application will not change unless you change the server to use a different port.
