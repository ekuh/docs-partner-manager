= Maps

Partner Manager uses DataWeave maps to transform business transactions between EDI message format (X12) and your organizationâ€™s enterprise application message formats, such as JSON and XML. 

You need to use the Anypoint X12 Connector and DataWeave to create EDI translation maps in Anypoint Studio and then import the map in to Partner Manager when you configure inbound or outbound message flows.
