|Setting |Description

|Endpoint Name
|Name used to easily identify the purpose of this endpoint. The name is auto-populated, but can be overwritten. +
Required: Yes +

|Description
|Describe any important details for this endpoint. +
Required: No +

| AS2 URL (Automatically generated at time of deployment)
| The HTTP or HTTPS address where you receive AS2 messages.
The port is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow that uses this endpoint.
You can see it by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.
The hostname displayed is created by your administrator at setup.


| Message Signature Encryption
| If your partner sends an encrypted signature in the message, choose the appropriate algorithm for validating that signature: +

Options are: +

`None` +

`MD5` +

`SHA1` +

`SHA224` +

`SHA256` +

`SHA384` +

`SHA512` +

Required: Yes +

| Encryption Algorithm
| The preferred algorithm for the encryption of received messages. +

Valid values:
`None` +
`3DES` +
`AES128` +
`AES192` +
`AES256` +
`AES256_WRAP` +
`CAST5` +
`IDEA` +
`RC2_CBC` +

Required: Yes +

| Message Subject
| Specify a default subject for messages you send to this partner +

Required: Yes +

| Encoding
| Type of encoding to use with AS2. +

Options are:

* `*Binary*` +
A method of encoding in which a message is represented using a combination of 0s and 1s.

* `*7-bit*`
+
Data that is represented as relatively short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation sequences.
No bytes with decimal values greater than 127 are allowed and neither are NULLs (bytes with decimal value 0).
CR (decimal value 13) and LF (decimal value 10) bytes only occur as part of CRLF line separation sequences.

* `*8-bit*`
+
Data that is represented as relatively
short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation
sequences. Bytes with decimal values greater than 127
can be used.  As with "7bit data" CR and LF bytes only occur as part
of CRLF line separation sequences. No NULLs are allowed.

* `*Base 64*`
+
Encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format to carry data across channels that only reliably support text content.
It is used to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.

* `*Quoted Printable*`
+
Intended to represent data that largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
the US-ASCII character set.

Required: Yes +

| Compress
| Indicates if the trading partner wants to see the incoming message and associated signature in compressed form.
Zlib is used for compression. +
Required: No +
Default: False +

|MDN Response Wait Time
|The maximum time within which the sender expects to receive an MDN. The value of this field is in seconds. +
Default: 60 +

| Partner from email
|The Sending partner’s email used in AS2 transmissions. +
Required: Yes +

| Partner to email
|The Receiving partner’s email used in AS2 transmissions. +
Required: Yes +
