| AS2 URL
| The HTTP or HTTPS address where you receive AS2 messages.

When deploying to CloudHub with a public Shared Load Balancer, the URL is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow that uses this endpoint.

To get the external facing URL of the AS2 receive endpoint deployed from Partner Manager (when deploying to CloudHub with Dedicated load balancer) refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer

You view it by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

If deploying to On-premises Mule with a Firewall and Load Balancer, work with your hosting or Network Security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS /host name where the Mule runtime server is executing, and replace {runtime_host} in the URL. For example, if the DNS host name is b2b.mycompany.com - the AS2 Receiver URL is: https://b2b.mycompany.com/receive-as2/
| <Host> public certificate
| This is your partnerâ€™s digital certificate (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol).
NOTE: If a single certificate is uploaded, Partner Manager prevents you from deleting your only certificate. +

Required: Yes +
