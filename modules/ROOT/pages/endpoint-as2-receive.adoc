| AS2 URL
| The HTTP or HTTPS address where you receive AS2 messages.

When deploying to CloudHub the URL is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow that uses this endpoint.
You can see the URL  by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

To get the external-facing URL of the AS2 receive endpoint deployed from Partner Manager (when deploying to CloudHub with Dedicated load balancer) refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer.

You view the URL by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

If deploying to on-premises Mule with a firewall and load balancer,
work with your hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or name of the host where the Mule runtime server is executing,
and replace {runtime_host} in the URL. For example, if the DNS host name is `b2b.mycompany.com` - the AS2 receiver URL is: `https://b2b.mycompany.com/receive-as2/`
