|Setting |Description

|Endpoint Name
|Name used to easily identify the purpose of this endpoint. The name is auto-populated, but can be overwritten. +
Required: Yes +

|Description
|Describe any important details for this endpoint. +
Required: No +

| AS2 URL
| The HTTP or HTTPS address where you receive AS2 messages.

When deploying to CloudHub the URL is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow that uses this endpoint.
You can see the URL  by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

You view the URL by selecting the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

If deploying to on-premises Mule with a firewall and load balancer,
work with your hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or name of the host where the Mule runtime server is executing,
and replace {runtime_host} in the URL. For example, if the DNS host name is `b2b.mycompany.com` - the AS2 receiver URL is: `https://b2b.mycompany.com/receive-as2/`

| <Host> public certificate
| This is your organizationâ€™s digital certificate (based on the RSA algorithm) for the AS2 transport protocol).
NOTE: If a single certificate is uploaded, Partner Manager prevents you from deleting your only certificate. +

Required: Yes +

| <Host> private key file
| This is your private key.

Required: Yes +

| Key passphrase
| This is the passphrase for your private key.

Required: Yes +
