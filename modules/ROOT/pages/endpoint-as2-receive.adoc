= AS2 Receive Endpoint Settings

Your AS2 endpoint settings determine where you receive inbound data from your trading partners. One AS2 endpoint can receive inbound data from multiple partners.

You can create the AS2 identifiers for your organization and for your trading partners in the respective xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner] profile pages.

|===
| Setting | Description | Required
| Endpoint Name
| The name used to identify the endpoint. The `Endpoint Name` is automatically generated, but can be modified manually.
| Yes

| Owner
| The trading partner or host that owns the endpoint. 
| Yes

| Protocol
| The protocol previously selected in the `Protocol` field of the *New endpoint: Receive from partners* window. This value cannot be subsequently modified.
| Yes

| Description
| The user-supplied description of the purpose and use of the endpoint.
| No

| AS2 URL
a| The HTTP or HTTPS address where you receive AS2 messages.

When deploying to CloudHub, the URL is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow that uses this endpoint. To view the URL, select the receiving endpoint from your deployed message flow.

If you are deploying to on-premises Mule server with a firewall and load balancer, work with your organization's hosting or network security team to obtain the externally accessible DNS or name of the host where the Mule server is executing. You must replace the {runtime_host} value in the URL with the value that is specific to your organization. For example, if the DNS host name is `b2b.mycompany.com`, the AS2 receiver URL is: `+https://b2b.mycompany.com/receive-as2/+`
| No

| <Host> public certificate
| The digital certificate for your organization. This certificate is based on the RSA algorithm for the AS2 transport protocol.

NOTE: You must have at least one certificate uploaded to the endpoint. If there is only one certificate uploaded to the endpoint, Partner Manager prevents you from deleting your only certificate.
| Yes

| <Host> private key file
| The private key.
| Yes

| Key passphrase
| The passphrase for your private key.
| Yes
