= SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings

You can use these settings to set up SFTP endpoints in one of the following contexts:

* Receive from partners +
Receive inbound EDI files from your trading partners used in inbound message flows.
* Source at host +
Receive application messages (in JSON or XML format) from your backend applications used in outbound message flows.

You can create the STFP identifiers for your organization and for your trading partners in the respective xref:configure-host.adoc[host] and xref:configure-partner.adoc[trading partner] profile pages.
