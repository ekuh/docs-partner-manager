After your message flow is running and you are using it with your partners, you should not have to do much to it, except in certain cases:

* You are no longer trading with a particular partner and need to delete the message flow you created for them.

* You completed the testing for a deployed message flow in a pre-production environment, and now want to reclaim the previously allocated Mule runtime resources.

* You want to change a message flow by adding identifiers, selecting different endpoints, or importing a different DataWeave map.

After a message flow is deployed, you can edit it, or undeploy and delete it.

== Edit Message Flows

After you establish a successful message flow with your partner, you can edit the flow to add identifiers, endpoints and message types, or add different DataWeave maps.
Before you make changes, carefully consider the impact to your existing message flow.

You can also undeploy or delete message flows entirely if your partner relationships change or you want to reclaim Mule resources used for testing.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production), click *Message Flows* in the upper left and select a *<Message flow name>* and click it to expand it.

. If you want to add an identifier to the message flow, click *See All* and then *New*.

. If you want to change a receiving endpoint, click *Select* from the *Receiving endpoint* section, click *New*, select your AS2 or SFTP protocol type.

. If you want to create a new endpoint (depending on the protocol) refer to one of the following:
+
* xref:endpoint-as2-receive.adoc[AS2 Endpoint Settings]

* xref:endpoint-sftp-receive-target.adoc[SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings]

. If you want to upload a different DataWeave map, click *Import* from the Map section to choose a different DataWeave map and click *Upload mapping*.

. If you want to add a message type, click *Select* under the Source message, select *New*, and select a standard type such as X12 or JSON.
+
* xref:document-types.adoc[X12 and JSON Message Types]

.   If you want to set up a target endpoint click *Select* from the Target at <partner name>, and depending on the protocol, refer to one of the following:

* xref:endpoint-sftp-receive-target.adoc[SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings]

* xref:endpoint-https-send.adoc[HTTP and HTTPS Send Configuration]

. Verify that any sections of the flow that you updated show a green checkmark in the interface, and click *Deploy* to deploy the configurations to Mule.

+
NOTE: It may take five minutes or so for your configuration changes to sync with Mule runtime.
+

. To test your edited message flow. See xref:configure-message-flows.adoc[Configure Message Flows].

After you confirm successful deployment of your message flow, you can track its processed messages from the Activity page.

== Undeploy Message Flows

Undeploying a message flow is a prerequisite to deleting it.
Undeployment can stop future messages from being processed, or enable you to recover resources being consumed by a message flow that you no longer need:
for example, if your relationship with your partner changes.

You can undeploy your message flow from either a sandbox or a production environment.

Before you undeploy a message flow, you must:

Ensure that your on-premise Mule instances, the servers hosting them, and the server group in Anypoint Runtime Manager called: `B2BserverGroup` are active and running by contacting your B2B System Administrator or checking the status of the server in Anypoint Runtime Manager (see https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/servers-settings[Server Settings]).
Understand that the process takes about five minutes, during which actions such as `Deploy` and `Delete` are unavailable.
Anypoint Partner Manager checks to see if any of the applications on your Mule runtime are orphaned as a result of the undeployment.
These applications are cleaned up to release any resources they may be consuming.

IMPORTANT: During this time, do not log out of Anypoint Partner Manager or close your browser window.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production), click _Message Flows_ in the upper left and select a message flow.

. Click *Undeploy* in the upper right.

== Delete Message Flows

You might want to delete a message flow when it no longer serves its purpose: for example, if your relationship with your partner changes.
If you delete a message flow before it has been deployed, it does not affect the Mule runtime apps.
Undeploying a message flow is a prerequisite to deleting it. You can delete your message flow from either a sandbox or a production environment.

Before you delete a message flow, you must:

Ensure that your on-premise Mule instances, the servers hosting them, and the server group in Anypoint Runtime Manager called: `B2BserverGroup` are active and running by contacting your B2B System Administrator or checking the status of the server in Anypoint Runtime Manager (see https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/servers-settings[Server Settings]).

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production), click _Message Flows_ in the upper left and select a message flow.

. Click *Undeploy* in the upper right.

. After the undeployment is successful, delete the message flow by clicking  *Delete* in the upper right.

Any previous transmissions that were created as a result of a message being processed via the now-deleted message flow has the following behavior:

* They continue to stay in the transmission records within the Activity page, but the records indicate that the corresponding message flow used to process this transmission is now deleted.

* These activities are converted into read-only mode, so no links to the message flow work.

* Only links that were set up to the stored payloads (such as the original B2B message, any TA1 acknowledgments, the transformed payload, on so on) continue to work.
