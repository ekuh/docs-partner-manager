endif::[]

Afer youâ€™ve set up your message flow and deployed, you might receive an error notification indicating that your deployment is unsuccessful.

== Causes

Any of the following can produce this type of error:

* You do not have the appropriate server group configured or have the wrong name for the server group.
* Your runtime servers are either not set up, or are not active.
* Your payload storage is not set up.

== Solutions

If you encounter these situations such as runtime servers not set up or active, or the payload storage is not set up then please review the following to resolve your issue.

=== Verify Server Group Setup

Verify that your `B2BServerGroup` is active:

. From Anypoint Platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and select your environment.
. Click _Servers_ from the left navigation.
. Verify that you have a server group named `B2BServerGroup` and that is shows the status: Running.

If you do not have this server group set up, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/partner-manager/2.0/setup#associate-mule-runtimes-for-deployment[Associate Mule Runtimes for Deployment].

If you see any status other than Running, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/servers-actions[Shut Down, Delete, or Restart Servers (Hybrid)].

=== Verify Runtime Server Setup

If your B2BServerGroup is in a Running state, then verify your runtime server.

. From Anypoint Platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and select your environment.
. Click Servers from the left navigation.
. Click `B2BServerGroup`.
. Within the server group, check for an instance of Mule runtime engine with the status Running.

If you see any status other than Running, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/servers-actions[Shut Down, Delete, or Restart Servers (Hybrid)].
If you do not see a server within the server group, it means that you do not have a Mule runtime server setup to process your B2B integrations and you should set one up by referring to https://docs.mulesoft.com/partner-manager/2.0/setup#associate-mule-runtimes-for-deployment[Associate Mule Runtimes for Deployment].

=== Verify Payload Storage Setup

Verify that your `Payload Storage` is active:

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager, Sandbox or Production environment select your <Hostname> profile.
. Scroll down to the `Payload storage` section and click *Edit*.
. Review your payload storage configuration.
+
If it is not configured, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/partner-manager/2.0/setup#setup-the-payload-storage-api[Set up the Payload Storage API].
+
. If your payload storage is already configured, leverage the configuration via a simple test request, using a browser extension such as Postman on Google Chrome to the configured payload storage endpoint.

If all these scenarios have been verified successfully, and you still cannot deploy message flows, please raise a case on the MuleSoft Support Portal.

If you have an existing commercial relationship with MuleSoft and are experiencing problems accessing your Anypoint Platform account, you can open a case from the https://help.mulesoft.com/s/support[MuleSoft Support Portal].
If you can't access the Support Portal, contact your Customer Success Manager or MuleSoft Account Management team for assistance.
