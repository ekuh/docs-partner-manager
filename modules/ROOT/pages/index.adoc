Anypoint Partner Manager allows Business-to-Business (B2B) message exchange using APIs and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) formats.

== Overview

Enterprises use Anypoint Partner Manager to carry out business transactions such as purchasing goods from one another.
They are typically transmitted over transports (such as HTTP(s), SFTP, and exchanges such as AS2) and use message formats such as X12 and JSON.
All of this is integrated into the Mule runtime.

Use Anypoint Partner Manager to set up, manage, and monitor the flow of messages between you and your business trading partners.
Create message flows. A message flow is the path along which a message travels from its source, through a DataWeave transformation map, to its target.
Monitor each transmission, the transfer of a payload and the validation of the messages it contains. The ability to track and report on this drives greater operational efficiency while managing B2B transactions.

With Anypoint Partner Manager you can:

* Perform technical on-boarding of your partners.

* Set up message flows to receive messages between your systems and your partners.

* View meta information, validation errors, and all messages included with each transmission payload.

// * Set up message flows to receive and send messages between your systems and your partners.
// * View and monitor how partner messages are being processed in the system in case of failure in order to take corrective action.

Partner Manager can be used by different people in your organization.
For example, those that design and test message flows, those who manage activity in your production environment, and those who optimize backend services and performance.

In order to use Partner Manager youâ€™ll need to be familiar with EDI message formats, and how to create Dataweave transformations.

To get started, have your Anypoint Platform administrator follow the Setup instructions.
