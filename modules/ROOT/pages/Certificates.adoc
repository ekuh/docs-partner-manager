== Certificate Settings

You can configure your SSL certificate settings for the different scenarios:

* uploading your own, self-signed certificate
* using a CA certificate (no upload is necessary)
* enable insecure connection for a test scenario

For example, you may need your partner’s digital certificate such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol.
