= Certificate Settings

All certificates in Anypoint Partner Manager are securely stored in the Anypoint Platform secrets manager, which uses secure vault technology to store and to control access to private keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets.

You can configure your SSL certificate settings based on your certificate needs.

Configure your certificate to include the following information:

* *Authority*: The certificate provider
* *Serial Number*: The serial number from the certificate
* *Status*: The status of the certificate. 
+
The color-coded icon on the certificate shows the user the status of the certificate:
** Green: The certificate is active
** Red: The certificate is inactive
* *Start Date*: The date from which the certificate is valid
* *Expires*: The date after which the certificate is no longer valid
* *Endpoints*: The number of endpoints using the certificate
* *Message Flows*: The number of message flows using the certificate

In Partner Manager, you can:

* Use a CA-signed certificate. +
If an endpoint is currently using a CA-signed certificate, you do not need to upload an additional certificate. +
* Upload your own, self-signed certificate. +
You can upload a new certificate (in `<certifcate name>.PEM` format) or view all the certificates available for use with this endpoint setup.
* Enable an insecure connection for local testing that doesnâ€™t perform certificate validation by selecting *Allow insecure connection*.

== Add Certificates

You can add certificates from the Host or Partner page.

. In Partner Manager's left navigation, select either *<host name>* or *Partners*. +
If you select *Partners*, select from the list displayed the partner to which you want to add the certificate.
. In the *Certificates* section, click *New*.
. In the *New certificate for <host name>* or the *New certificate for Partners* window, in the *Certificate* field, click *Choose file* to upload a certificate.
. Click *Upload Certificate*. +
The new certificate is added to the host or the trading partner.

== Delete Certificates

You can delete certificates that are not deployed or associated with endpoints.

You cannot delete a certificate if it is the only certificate that is uploaded.

To delete a certificate:

. In Partner Manager's left navigation, select *<host name>* or *Partners*. +
If you select Partners, select the parter to which you want to add the certificate from the list.
. In the *Certificates* section, click the certificate to delete.
