You can configure your SSL certificate settings based on your certificate needs.
All certificates in Anypoint Partner Manager are securely stored in Anypoint platform's secrets manager.
It uses a secure vault technology to store and control access to private keys, passwords, certificates, and other secrets.

You can:

* Use a CA-signed certificate where no upload is necessary. +
You do not require an additional certificate because this endpoint already uses a CA-signed certificate. +

* Upload your own, self-signed certificate. +
You can upload a new certificate (in `.PEM` format), or view all the certificates available for use with this endpoint setup. +

* Enable an insecure connection for local testing that doesnâ€™t perform certificate validation. +
You can use Allow insecure connection. +
