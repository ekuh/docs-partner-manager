There are three types of endpoints within AnyPoint Partner Manager:

* Receive - On the Host side, you need endpoints your organization uses to receive transmissions from your partners.

* Target - As the Host, your organization has internal endpoints where you route messages from the Partner after they are transformed within the message flow.

* Send - Your partners provide you with endpoint configurations to use for sending them transmissions, including acknowledgement messages like 997s.
