= Endpoint Types and Protocols

There are three types of endpoints within AnyPoint Partner Manager:

* Receive endpoints. +
Your organization needs to provide endpoints to receive transmissions from your trading partners. +
These endpoints are resources your organization exposes to your trading partners.

* Target endpoints. +
Your organization also has internal endpoints to which it routes messages from the trading partners. The messages routed to the target endpoint are typically validated and transformed before they are routed to the configured target endpoint.

* Acknowledgement endpoints +
Your partners provide you with their own endpoint configurations to which your organization can send acknowledgments, such as an X12 997 or X12 999. Acknowledgments are typically sent back to trading partners and correspond to one or more B2B messages you receive from your trading partners.

Refer to the following to configure your endpoint. Your configuration varies based on the protocol you are using.

== Delete Endpoints

From either the Partner or Host page, you can delete any endpoints that are not used in message flow configurations.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager Sandbox or Production environment, select Partner or <host partner name> from the upper left.

. Search for the endpoint you want to delete by Name, Protocol, URL, or Description.
+
You can perform a search from within _Endpoints: Receive from partners_, _Endpoints: Targets at <partner name>_ for the Host, or _Endpoints: Send to <partner name>_ for your partners.

. If you can’t remember what to search for, scan the list for any endpoints that don’t have a message flow associated with them indicated by a 0 in the message flow column.

. Hover over the endpoint name with your mouse until you see the garbage can icon, click it and click *Delete*.
