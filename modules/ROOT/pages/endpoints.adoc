There are three types of endpoints within AnyPoint Partner Manager:


* Receive endpoints. +
Your organization will need to provide endpoints to receive transmissions from your trading partners. +
These endpoints are resources your organization exposes to your trading partners.

* Target endpoints. +
Your organization also has internal endpoints to which it routes messages from the trading partners. the messages routed to the target endpoint are typically validated and transformed before they are routed to the configured target endpoint.

* Acknowledgement endpoints +
Your partners provide you with their own endpoint configurations to which your organization can send + acknowledgments, such as a X12 997 or X12 999. Acknowledgements are typically sent back to trading partners and correspond to one or more B2B messages you receive from your trading partners.
