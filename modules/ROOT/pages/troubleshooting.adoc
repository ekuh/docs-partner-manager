You’ve set up your message flow and clicked Deploy. You may receive an error notification indicating that your deployment is unsuccessful.

== Cause

//<In this section, include information about what causes this issue, if possible. Remember to make the title plural if there are more than one causes listed.>
Any of the following can produce this type of error:

You do not have the appropriate server group configured or have the wrong name for the server group. Check Verify Server Group Setup.
Your runtime servers are either not set up, or are not active. Check Verify Runtime Server Setup.
Your payload storage is not set up. Check Verify Payload Storage Setup.


== Solutions

If you encounter these situations then please review the following to resolve your issue.

=== Verify Server Group Setup

Verify that your `B2BServerGroup` is active.

. From the Anypoint platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and select your environment.
. Click Servers from the left navigation.
. Verify that you have a server group named `B2BServerGroup` and that is shows should have the status: Running.

If you do not have this server group set up, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/partner-manager/2.0/setup#associate-mule-runtimes-for-deployment[Associate Mule Runtimes for Deployment].

If you see any status other Running, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/servers-actions[Shut down, Delete, or Restart Servers (Hybrid)].


=== Verify Runtime Server Setup

If your B2BServerGroup is in a Running state, then verify your runtime server.
. From the Anypoint platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and select your environment.
. Click *Servers* from the left navigation.
. Click `B2BServerGroup`.
. Within the server group, check for Mule runtime with status Running.

If you see any status other Running, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/servers-actions[Shut down, Delete, or Restart Servers (Hybrid)].
If you do not see a server within the server group, it means that you do not have a Mule runtime server setup to process your B2B integrations and you should set up a runtime server by referring to https://docs.mulesoft.com/partner-manager/2.0/setup#associate-mule-runtimes-for-deployment[Associate Mule Runtimes for Deployment]


=== Verify Payload Storage Setup
 Verify that your `Payload Storage` is active.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production) select your <Hostname> profile.
. Scroll down to the `Payload storage` section and click *Edit*.
. Review your payload storage configuration, and if it is not configured, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/partner-manager/2.0/setup#setup-the-payload-storage-api[Set up the Payload Storage API].
. If your payload storage is already configured, you can leverage the configuration via a simple test request (use a browser extension such as Postman on Google Chrome) to the configured payload storage endpoint.

If all these scenarios have been verified successfully, and you still cannot deploy message flows, please raise a case on MuleSoft’s customer portal.
