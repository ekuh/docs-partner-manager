= Create and Configure an Outbound Message Flow

Create an outbound message flow to receive application messages from your backend systems, transform, and then send the translated EDI message to your trading partners.

After you create the outbound message flow, you configure the receive endpoint, source message type, target message type, and target endpoint.

== Create an Outbound Message Flow

. From your Anypoint Partner Manager sandbox or production environment, select *Message Flows* in the left navigation menu.
. Click *New message flow > Send to partner* in the upper right of the page.
. Select an existing Partner from the list and click *Select*. +
A new message flow is created. +
. Alternatively, you can create a new partner:
.. From the *Select a partner* dialog, click *New* to create a new partner.
.. Follow the process to xref:configure-partner.adoc#create-partner[create a Trading Partner].
.. Click *Create Partner and Message Flow*.

== Configure the Source at Host Endpoint

. Expand the *Source at <host-name>* section.
. In *Endpoint:Source at <host-name>*, click *Select*.
. To use an existing receiving endpoint:
.. Select the endpoint from the list and click *Select* in the lower right side of the page. +
The endpoint is added to the message flow, and a message appears indicating that the endpoint is missing an identifier.
.. Click *Add* to add a unique identifier for the endpoint.
. To create a new receiving endpoint:
.. Click *New* on the right of the search box.
.. From the *Owner* drop-down list, select the endpoint's owner.
.. From the *Protocol* drop-down, select the protocol and configure it according to the protocol you select:
* xref:endpoint-https-send.adoc[*HTTP(S)*]
* xref:endpoint-sftp-send.adoc[*SFTP*]
. Click *Save*. +
The endpoint is added to the message flow.

== Configure the Source Message Type

. Expand the *Source message type* section, and click *Select*.
. To use an existing message type, select the message type from the list and click *Select* in the lower right side of the page. +
The message type is added to the message flow.
. To create a new message type:
.. Click *New* on the right side of the search box.
.. From *Format*, select either:
* *JSON*
* *XML*
.. From *Schema*, click *Choose file* and browse to the location of your custom schema.
.. Accept the default value for *Message type identifier* or enter a new value.
.. Click *Choose file* to browse to the location of the DataWeave map and select it.
.. Click *Save*.
. Under the *Reference IDs* section:
.. Click *Select* to add the reference identifier for the trading partner.
.. From the *<host-name> reference ID* drop-down list, select your organizationâ€™s internal reference ID (such as business unit name) as it would appear in the data element of the source JSON or XML payload from your backend systems.

== Configure the Target Message Type

. Expand the *Message type* section.
. Click *Select* to select a message type or to create a new message type.
. To use an existing message type, select the message type from the list and click *Select*.
. To create a new message type:
.. Click *New* on the right of the search box.
.. From *Format*, select *X12*.
.. From *Version*, select the X12 version.
.. From *Message type*, select the message type.
.. From schema select *Use standard X12-<version>-<message-type>* or select *Customize* to define a custom schema.
.. Click *Save*. +
The message type and its validation settings are added to the message flow.
. In the *Acknowledgment* section, select the *Expect functional acknowledgment* checkbox if you expect to receive functional acknowledgments (997) back from your trading partner.
. Click *Select* to specify the endpoint from which to receive the acknowledgement transactions from your partner. +
. Alternatively, you can create a new receive from partner endpoint:
.. Click *New*.
.. From *Owner*, select the endpoint owner.
.. From *Protocol*, select the protocol and configure it accordingly:
* *AS2*
* *SFTP*
.. Click *Save*.
. In *Mark overdue after*, accept the default value of *24 Hours* or configure values based on when you want the outbound transaction to be designated as overdue for an acknowledgment, according to the SLAs you have with your trading partner. +
When functional acknowledgement is not received within the specified timer value, Partner Manager marks the outbound transactions as `Overdue`.
. In the *X12 Settings* drop-down list, select the X12 settings.
+
By default, Partner Manager uses the X12 send settings that are configured in the trading partner profile page for message validation, delimiters, and character encoding.
+
If you want to apply custom validation settings and delimiters for the message flow you are setting up, you can select *Custom X12 settings* and provide custom configuration values.
. In *X12 Identifiers*, select the sender and receiver identifiers that are configured under the host and trading partner profiles to use them on the X12 ISA and GS segments.

== Import the Translation Map

Expand the *Map* section and click *Import* to translate the application message format to EDI.

Follow xref:create-map-json-xml-to-outbound-x12.adoc[these instructions] to create your application message-to-outbound EDI map (JSON or XML) in Anypoint Studio.

== Verify the Message Flow is Complete

Partner Manager dynamically validates the message flow configuration elements for completeness and displays a green checkmark if all the building blocks of the message flow are complete. After you verify the configurations, you are ready to deploy the message flow.
