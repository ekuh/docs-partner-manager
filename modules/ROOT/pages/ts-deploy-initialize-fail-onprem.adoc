= Deployment Initialization failed (with On Premise Deployment target)

ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

== Causes

* You do not have the appropriate server group configured or have the wrong name for the server group in your deployed environment for the message flow.

* Your runtime servers are either not set up or are not active.

== Solution

* Log in to Anypoint Platform > *Runtime Manager* in the same environment.

* Click *Servers* and verify that you have the server group `B2BServerGroup` configured and is in `Running` Status.

* If the server group is in a `stopped` status contact your MuleSoft platform operations or administration team to review and restart the server.

If you do not have this server group setup, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/partner-manager/2.0/setup#setup[Setup Anypoint Partner Manager].
