Causes:
You do not have the appropriate server group configured or have the wrong name for the server group in the environment in which you are deploying the message flow.
Your runtime servers are either not set up, or are not active.

Solution:
Login to Anypoint Platform â†’ Runtime Manager in the same environment
Click Servers and verify that you have the server group B2BServerGroup configured and is in Running Status.
If the server group is in a stopped status - contact your MuleSoft platform operations/admin team to review and restart the server
If you do not have this server group setup, refer to Setup Anypoint Partner Manager.
