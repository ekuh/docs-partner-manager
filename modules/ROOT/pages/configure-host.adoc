= Configure and Manage a Host Profile

Your Anypoint Platform organization or your business group is referred to as the "host" in Anypoint Partner Manager. In Anypoint Platform, your host name is the same as your Anypoint Platform business group name. 

Use the host page in Partner Manager to:

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify yourself.
* Add digital certificates associated with your organization.
* Create new receive, target, and send endpoints.
* Create new message types.
* Configure the details associated with the Payload Storage API you configured as part of Partner Manager setup. 

== Host Configuration Settings

To configure the host, you need the following information about your organization:

* Your organization's identifiers, such as the AS2 ID, X12-ISA, X12 GS, and so on
* Endpoints +
There are three types of endpoints you'll work with in AnyPoint Partner Manager, including:
** Receive endpoints +
Your organization needs to provide endpoints to receive transmissions from your trading partners. +
These endpoints are resources your organization exposes to your trading partners.
** Target endpoints +
Your organization also has internal endpoints to which it routes messages from the trading partners. The messages routed to the target endpoint are typically validated and transformed before they are routed to the configured target endpoint.
** Acknowledgment endpoints +
Your partners provide you with their own endpoint configurations to which your organization can send acknowledgments, such as an X12 997 or X12 999. Acknowledgments are typically sent back to trading partners and correspond to one or more B2B messages you receive from your trading partners.
* Your digital certificates, such as an X.509 certificate
* Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) message type preferences for your organization
* DataWeave transformation maps your organization uses for B2B transformations +
Use Anypoint Studio to create the DataWeave transformation maps before you use Partner Manager.

== Update the Host's Profile

On the host page, you can configure your indentifiers, certificates, and the location and configuration of your payload storage.

. Open Anypoint Partner Manager and select the name of your organization from the left navigation menu. 
. In the *Identifiers* section, click *New* to add an identifier related to your organization.
. Select an identifier type from the *Type* drop-down list. +
The identifier type uniquely identifies you. +
For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: 
* AS2
* DUNS number
* X12 GS
* X12-ISA
. Provide a value for your identifier and a qualifier for X12-ISA and click *Create identifier* to save your changes. +
See xref:x12-identity-settings.adoc[Identifiers] for more information about X12-ISA settings.
. In *Certificates* section, click *New* to upload any needed digital certificates, such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol.
. Click *Choose file* to select the certificate (typically a `<certificate name>.PEM` file), and click *Upload certificate* to upload your chosen certificate file. +
See xref:Certificates.adoc[Certificates] for more information about configuring certificates in Partner Manager.
. From *Endpoints: Receive from partners* or *Endpoints: Targets at <partner name>*, click *New* and select your protocol type.
. Set up your endpoint based on the protocol type you selected:
* xref:endpoint-as2-receive.adoc[AS2 Endpoint Settings]
* xref:endpoint-sftp-receive-target.adoc[SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings]
* xref:endpoint-https-send.adoc[HTTP and HTTPS Send Configuration]
. Click *Save*.
. If you need to make changes later, for example, changing the URL location, timeout settings, or acknowledgments, click *Edit* in the *Payload storage* section.
