Your organization or your business group is considered the host partner in Anypoint Partner Manager.
In the Anypoint platform, your hostname is the same name as your Anypoint Platform business group.
An Anypoint Platform business group is a self-contained resource that was set up to hold Anypoint Platform resources such as APIs and applications.

Within the host page you can do the following:

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify yourself.

* Add digital certificates associated to your organization.

* Configure details associated to the Payload Storage API (the same one that was configured as part of the the Setup instructions).
The storage API is a mandatory configuration where your B2B message payloads are stored.

== Update the Host's Profile

. Open Anypoint Partner Manager and select the name of your organization from the left navigation pane.
You can configure the your indentifiers, certificates, and the location and configuration of your payload storage.

. Click *New* within the *Identifiers* section to begin adding an identifier related to your organization.

. Select an identifier type from the *Type* drop-down menu. This uniquely identifies you.
For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: AS2, DUNS number, X12 GS, or X12-ISA.

. Provide a value for your identifier (and qualifier for X12-ISA) and click *Create identifier* to save your changes. See xref:x12-identity-settings.adoc[Identifiers] for more information on X12-ISA settings.

. Click *New* within the *Certificates* section to begin to upload any needed digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol).

. Click *Choose file* to select the certificate (typically a `.PEM` file), and click *Upload certificate* to upload the chosen digital certificate file. See xref:Certificates.adoc[Certificates] for more info on configuring certificates in Partner Manager.

. (Optional) Click *Edit* within the *Payload storage* section to change any of the information that was completed when the payload storage was set up. For example, URL location, timeout settings, and acknowledgments.
