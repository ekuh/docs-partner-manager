Your organization is considered the host partner in Anypoint Partner Manager.
Within the Host page, which is named after your organization, you can do the following:

* Add B2B identifiers to uniquely identify yourself with your partners.
* Add certificates owned by your organization.
* Configure global validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings.

== Configure the host

. Open Partner Manager.
. From within your Partner Manager environment, select the name of your organization from the left-hand navigation.

You can add the following information as the host organization, by opening this from the *Partners* selection in the left-hand navigation.

* B2B Identifiers such as the AS2 Identifier, X12 ISA, X12 GS, or DUNS.

* Sending, Receiving, and Partner Endpoints - There are three types of endpoints within AnyPoint Partner Manager:

** From the Host side, you need ones to receive transmissions from your partners (where you route messages from your partners to a target at your backend systems).
+
** Sources of messages from your backend system that you send to your partners.
+
** From the Partner side, youâ€™ll want information from where you send transmissions to your partners - including acknowledgments.

* Digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol).

* EDI message type preferences for your organization.

* Any Dataweave transformation maps your organization uses for EDI.

* Storage for your B2B message payloads.

Refer to X12 Settings to change any of the default settings for all X12 received messages.
