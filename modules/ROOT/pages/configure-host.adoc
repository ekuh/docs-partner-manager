Your organization or your business group is considered the host partner in Anypoint Partner Manager.
In the Anypoint platform, your hostname is the same name as your Anypoint Platform business group.
An Anypoint Platform business group is a self-contained resource that was set up to hold Anypoint Platform resources such as APIs and applications.

Within the host page you can do the following:

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify yourself.

* Add digital certificates associated with your organization.

* Configure details associated with the Payload Storage API (the same one that was configured as part of the Setup instructions).

The storage API is a mandatory configuration where your B2B message payloads are stored.

== Update the Host's Profile

. Open Anypoint Partner Manager and select the name of your organization from the left navigation pane.
You can configure your indentifiers, certificates, and the location and configuration of your payload storage.

. Click *New* within the *Identifiers* section to begin adding an identifier related to your organization.

. Select an identifier type from the *Type* drop-down menu. This uniquely identifies you.
For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: AS2, DUNS number, X12 GS, or X12-ISA.

. Provide a value for your identifier (and qualifier for X12-ISA) and click *Create identifier* to save your changes. See xref:x12-identity-settings.adoc[Identifiers] for more information on X12-ISA settings.

. Click *New* within the *Certificates* section to begin to upload any needed digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol).

. Click *Choose file* to select the certificate (typically a `.PEM` file), and click *Upload certificate* to upload your chosen certificate file. See xref:Certificates.adoc[Certificates] for more info on configuring certificates in Partner Manager.
+
NOTE: If a single certificate is uploaded, Partner Manager prevents you from deleting your only certificate.
+
. Click *New* from within Endpoints: Receive from partners or Endpoints: Targets at <partner name> for the Host, and select your protocol type.

. Set up your endpoint based on the protocol type you selected.

For more information on your protocol type refer to:

* xref:endpoint-sftp-receive-target.adoc[SFTP Receive Endpoint Settings]

* xref:endpoint-https-send.adoc[HTTP and HTTPS Send Configuration]

. Save when you are done.

. If you need to change any of the information that was completed when the payload storage was set up, click *Edit* within the *Payload storage* section.

For example, URL location, timeout settings, and acknowledgments.

Refer to xref:x12-identity-settings.adoc[Identifiers] for information on deleting an identifier.
