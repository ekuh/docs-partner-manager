Your organization or your business group is considered the host partner in Anypoint Partner Manager.
In the Anypoint platform, your hostname is the same name as your Anypoint business group.
An Anypoint business group is a self-contained resource that was set up to contain Anypoint Platform resources such as APIs and applications.

Within the host page you can do the following:

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify yourself.

* Add digital certificates associated to your organization.

* Configure validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings applicable to all message flows across all trading partners.
You can reuse this global configuration in all message flows with all your trading partners.

* Configure details associated to the Payload Storage API (same one you configured as part of the the Setup instructions).
The storage API is a mandatory configuration where your B2B message payloads are stored.

== Update the Host's Profile

. Open Anypoint Partner Manager and select the name of your organization from the left navigation pane.
Configure the following based on your indentifier and certificate type.
This includes any global settings you need to modify, and the location of your payload storage configuration.

. Add an identifier related to your organization by clicking *New* within the *Identifiers* section.

. Select an identifier type from the *Type* drop-down menu. This uniquely identifies you.
For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: AS2, X12 ISA, X12 GS, or the DUNS number.

. Provide a value for your identifier (and qualifier for X12 ISA) and click *Create identifier* to save your changes.
When an identifier is successfully created you receive a confirmation message.

. Click *New* within the *Certificates* section to upload any needed digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol).

. Click *Choose file* to select and upload the certificate (typically a `.PEM` file).

. Click *Upload certificate* to upload the chosen digital certificate file. When a certificate is successfully uploaded you receive a confirmation message.

. Optionally, you click *Edit* to change any of the information that was completed when the payload storage was set up. For example, URL location, timeout settings, acknowledgments.

. Configure X12 validation settings that can be used for all message flows that you are configuring with your trading partners. These include:

* Validations
* Acknowledgment
* Control numbers
* Character sets
