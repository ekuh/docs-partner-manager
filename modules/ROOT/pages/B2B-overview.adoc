== B2B Solutions and Overview

B2B (Business-to-Business) is the use of API's or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) by enterprises to carry out business transactions such as purchasing goods from each other. B2B messages are typically sent over transports such as HTTP(s), FTP, FTPS, SFTP, JMS, and exchanges such as AS2. MuleSoft's B2B solutions integrate seamlessly into the Mule runtime.

This overview introduces MuleSoft's B2B solution and links to pages that provide B2B implementation examples in the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule’s graphical user interface. In addition, provides links to configuration details for implementing Anypoint B2B in Anypoint Studio’s XML Editor.
