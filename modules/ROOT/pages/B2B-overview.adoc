Anypoint Partner Manager enables you to manage the transmission of business messages with a large number of trading partners through the creation and deployment of message flows.
A message flow is the path along which a message travels from its source, through a DataWeave transformation map, to its target.

You'll need to perform some tasks before you can begin transmitting messages with your trading partners.
A transmission is a single communication event during which a payload is transferred between two business entities. These payloads can contain one or more business messages.

In anypoint Partner Manager, you set yourself up as a host partner, configure your trading partners, and then create message flows between you and your trading partners.

== Prepare to Configure Anypoint Partner Manager

Before you configure your message flows to send and receive messages with your trading partners, you'll need to collect some information from them.
Youâ€™ll also need to have an understanding of how your backend systems work.

Information you'll need about your organization:

* Your organization's identifiers (such as the AS2 ID, X12 ISA, X12 GS, and so on).

* Endpoints: There are three types of endpoints within AnyPoint Partner Manager -

** Receive endpoints - On the Host side, to receive a transmission from your trading partner you need endpoints that your organization reveals to your trading partners.

** Target endpoints - As the Host, your organization has internal endpoints where you route messages from the trading partner, after they are transformed within the message flow.

** Acknowledgement endpoints - Your partners provide you with endpoint configurations that can be used by you to send acknowledgement messages (like a X12 997 or a X12 999) back to them.
Acknowledgements are typically sent back to trading partners based on one or more B2B messages that you receive from them.

* Your digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate).

* Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) message type preferences for your organization.

* DataWeave transformation maps your organization uses for B2B transformations.

Information you need about each trading partner:

* The trading Partners name (usually the name of the company).

* Partner identifiers (such as the AS2 ID, X12 ISA, X12 GS, and so on).

* Partner endpoints (where you send transmissions to your partners, including acknowledgement endpoints).

* EDI message format preferences for your partner (such as X12), and any associated validations such as the need for acknowledgments (like TA1, 997, 999, and so on).

* Message types to use. For example, a purchase order in X12 is an 850 message. You also need to know the X12 version to use in your transactions (such as 004010, 005010, and so on).

* Your Trading Partner's digital certificates (such as an X.509 certificate).

After gathering this information, you are ready to configure yourself as host, configure your trading partners, and create a message flow.
