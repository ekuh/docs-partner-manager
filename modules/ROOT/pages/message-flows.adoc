= Partner Manager Message Flows 

A message flow is the path along which a message travels from its source, through a DataWeave transformation map, to its target.
You set up message flows to send and receive messages between your systems and your trading partners. 

Partner Manager message flows consist of objects such as endpoints, message types, identifiers, and mapping. Partner Manager’s message framework orchestrates the processing of your business transactions from source to target using these configuration objects as shown in the following diagram:

You can create message flows in one of the following contexts:

* Inbound +
Receive messages from trading partners
* Outbound +
Send messages to trading partners. An outbound message flow receives application messages from your backend systems, translates the message to EDI, and sends the EDI transmissions to your trading partner.


== Inbound Message Flows

Create an inbound message flow to receive EDI transactions from your trading partner, transform, and then send the translated application message to your backend systems.

The following diagram shows the inbound message configuration building blocks of an inbound message flow and how the Partner Manager’s message processing framework orchestrates the end-to-end routing and transformation of your inbound EDI transactions from your trading partners to your backend systems at runtime.


. Receiving endpoint +
Endpoint where you (the host) receive transmissions from the trading partner. Supported protocols include:
* AS2 
* SFTP
. Source message type +
Message type to process for this message flow, using the EDI X12 formats and EDI identifiers.
. Transform +
The DataWeave map for EDI to transform into XML or JSON formats.
. Target message type +
Supported formats include JSON and XML. 
This is also the format into which DataWeave map transforms received messages.
. Target endpoint +
The target endpoint is the final destination of a message flow and is defined by a host message type and endpoint, often a host API. Supported protocols include:
* SFTP
* HTTP
* HTTPS



To configure the source section of the message flow, you need the following information:

* The partner's name and associated identifiers (such as X12-ISA, X12 GS, and so on)

* The endpoint where you, as the host, receive transmissions

* The message type to process for this message flow (such as X12, 4010, 850, and so on)

* The endpoint where your partner might want to receive an acknowledgment related to the messages they send

* A DataWeave map to transform the received message contents into a format you can use

To configure the target section of the message flow, you need the following information:

* The message type your system understands. +
This is also the format into which DataWeave map transforms received messages.
* The endpoint in your organization where you route the transformed message. +
If a separate URL is required for returning MDNs, it is sent in the AS2 transmission and Anypoint Partner Manager reads it from there.
