= Create a Receive Message Flow from Your Partner
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

To receive messages from a trading partner, create a message flow and configure the sections for both the source and target. Your organization is typically referred to as the `host`, while the partner you interact with is refered to as a `trading partner`.

For the receiving endpoint - this is the origin of the message flow when defined by a host endpoint and message type, often an API. For the target endpoint - this is the final destination of a message flow when defined by a host endpoint and message type, often a Host API.

You'll need the following for the Source:

* The trading partner and associated identifiers (such as X12 ISA, X12 GS, and so on)

* The endpoint where you receive the transmission

* The message type to process for this message flow (such as X12 4010 850 and so on)

* The endpoint where your trading partner may want to receive an acknowlegement related to the transactions they send

* The DataWeave map that transforms the received message contents into a format you prefer

You'll need the following for the Target:

* The message type your system understands. This is also the format that dataweave transforms received messages into

* The endpoint in your organization where you route the transformed message

If a separate URL is required for returning MDNs, it is sent in the AS2 transmission and Partner Manager reads it from there.

. Setup the target within your organization where you want to forward the transformed message. Click on the `Map` section to expand it. Within this section, proceed to setup the target message type and the endpoint where you want to route the transformed message.

** Setup a target message type. Click on the `select` button. In the ensuing modal window, proceed to either search and select and existing message type, or create a new message type. To create a new message type, depending on the message standard, follow instructions below
*** Setting up JSON message type

** Setup a target endpoint. Click on the `select` button. In the ensuing modal window, proceed to either search and select and existing endpoint, or create a new endpoint. To create a new endpoint, depending on the protocol, follow instructions below
