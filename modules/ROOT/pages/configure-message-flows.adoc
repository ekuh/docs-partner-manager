= Create a Receive Message Flow from Your Partner
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

To receive messages from a trading partner, create a message flow and configure the sections for both the source, mapping, and the target. Your organization is typically referred to as the host, while the enterprise you interact with is refered to as a trading partner.

For the receiving endpoint - this is the origin of the message flow when defined by a host endpoint and message type, often an API.

For the target endpoint - this is the final destination of a message flow when defined by a host endpoint and message type, often a Host API.

You'll need the following for the Source:

* The trading partner's name and associated identifiers (such as X12 ISA, X12 GS, and so on)

* The endpoint where you receive the transmission

* The message type to process for this message flow (such as X12, 4010, 850, and so on)

* The endpoint where your trading partner may want to receive an acknowlegement related to the transactions they send 

* The DataWeave map that transforms the received message contents into a format you prefer

You'll need the following for the Target:

* The message type your system understands. This is also the format that DataWeave transforms received messages into

* The endpoint in your organization where you route the transformed message

If a separate URL is required to returning MDNs, it is sent in the AS2 transmission and Anypoint Partner Manager reads it from there.

. Click the `Upload map` button to successfully upload your dataweave map.

. To set up the target within your organization where you want to forward the transformed message, click on the `Map` section to expand it.

Either search and select and existing endpoint, or create a new endpoint.
[start=18]

[xref] Setting up SFTP endpoint

[xref] Setting up HTTP / HTTPS endpoint

When you complete all of the sections - they will have a green check mark next to all of them in the flow, you can deploy your message flow and start receiving messages from your partner.
