When receiving a B2B message from your trading partner, it may include more than one URL. For example, a receiving URL, and a URL for receiving asynchronous MDNs (Message Disposition Notifications). If this is the case, you only need to configure the Receiving URL. If a separate URL is required for returning MDNs, it is sent in the AS2 transmission and Partner Manager reads it from there.

== To set up Receive from partner:

. Select Message Flows from the left-hand navigation. +
. Click the *New Message Flow* button and select Receive from partner from the drop-down menu. +
. Associate an existing partner that you created, or click the *New Partner button* to create one. +

If you are creating a new partner, fill in the receiving endpoint. 


. Select the Source message. +
. Import the Dataweave script for the Map file. +
. Select the Target document type. +
. Click *Done* when the setup is complete. +
. Click *Deploy* when you are ready to make the created flow live. +
