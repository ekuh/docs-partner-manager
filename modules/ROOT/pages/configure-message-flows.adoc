= Create and Configure an Inbound Message Flow

You can create and configure an inbound message flow either when you create a trading partner, or after you create a trading partner. After you deploy the message flow, it's best to test it.

. From your Anypoint Partner Manager *Sandbox* or *Production* environment, select *Message Flows* in the left navigation menu. 
. Click *New message flow > Receive from partner* in the upper right of the page.
. Select an existing Partner from the list and click *Select*. +
A new message flow is created. +
Alternatively, from the *Select a partner* dialog, you can click *New* to create a new partner.
Follow the process to xref:configure-partner.adoc#create-a-trading-partner[create a Trading Partner], except that when you are finished, click *Create Partner and Message Flow*.
. Click each section of the message flow to expand it. +
A green checkmark next to a section indicates that it is complete.
. Expand the *Receiving endpoint* section and click *Select*.
. To use an existing receiving endpoint, select the endpoint from the list and click *Select* in the lower right side of the page. +
To create a new receiving endpoint, click *New* on the right of the search box and follow the instructions for creating a new endpoint. 
+
[NOTE]
Translated files are delivered to file-based endpoints with a unique file name with the pattern `<doctype>-<senderid>-<ISACtrlNum>-<GSCtrlNum>-<STCtrlNum>-<timeInMillis>.<format>`, for example: `850-ABCCORP-40952-5850-179960-1587685726355.JSON`
. Expand the *Source message type* section, and click *Select*.
. To use an existing message type, select the message type from the list and click *Select* in the lower right side of the page. +
To create a new message type, click *New* on the right side of the search box and follow the instructions for creating a message type. 
. Expand the *Map* section and click *Import* to upload the DataWeave map to translate the EDI message to your application message format. +
Follow these instructions to create your inbound EDI-to-application message (JSON or XML) map in Anypoint Studio.
. Expand the *Target at <your organization>* section. 
. Select the message type of your backend system to which to map the EDI transaction. +
Partner Manager routes inbound EDI transactions based on matching identifiers configured at the Partner level. 
. Select the endpoint to which to send the translated message (XML or JSON) for further processing in your backend system. +
In the *Select endpoint* window, click *New* to create a new endpoint. +
Partner Manager routes inbound EDI transactions based on matching identifiers configured at the Partner level.

Partner Manager dynamically validates the message flow configuration elements for completeness and displays a green checkmark if all the building blocks of the message flow are complete. After you verify the configurations, you are ready to deploy the message flow.
