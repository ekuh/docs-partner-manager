Message flow diagram here? - Inbound transmission - validate transmission payload - route to message flows - route through message flows

When receiving a B2B message from your trading partner, you only need to configure the receiving URL in cases where there may be more than one URL.
If a separate URL is required for returning MDNs, it is sent in the AS2 transmission and Partner Manager reads it from there.

== Set up Receive from a Partner:

. From within your Partner Manager environment, select *Message Flows* from the left-hand navigation.
. Click the *New Message Flow* button and select *Receive from partner* from the drop-down menu.
. Associate an existing partner that you created, or click the *New Partner* button to create one.

If you are creating a new partner, be sure to fill in the receiving endpoint.
. Select the Source message.
. Import the Dataweave script for the Map file. This must be a valid DataWeave 2.0 file.
. Select the Target document type.
. Click *Done* when the setup is complete.
. Click *Deploy* when you are ready to make the created flow live.

From here you can check the Reference section for detailed information on various settings.

// == Create a Send Message Flow from Your Partner
// When sending a B2B message from your trading partner, it may include more than one URL. For example, a sending URL, and a URL for sending asynchronous MDNs (Message Disposition Notifications). If this is the case, you only need to configure the Sending URL. If a separate URL is required for returning MDNs, it is sent in the AS2 transmission and Partner Manager reads it from there.
