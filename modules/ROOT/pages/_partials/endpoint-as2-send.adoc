== AS2 Send Settings

AS2 Send Settings pertain to trading partner-specific AS2 settings such as *certificate* and *URL*.

[%header,cols="3s,7a"]
|===
|Setting |Description

| URL

|The HTTP/S address at which your partner is accepting incoming AS2 messages. +


Required?::
Yes, if AS2 is the transport protocol

Valid values::

Alphanumeric

Default::

None

Example::
`www.midsizesupplier.com:8080`

| Subject

|The field that specifies a default subject for messages you send out to this partner. +

Required?::
Yes

Valid values::

Alphanumeric

Default::
`None`

| Encoding

| Type of encoding to use when sending a message with AS2. +

Required::
Yes

Default::
Binary

Valid values::

* *Binary* +
A method of encoding in which a message is represented using a combination of 0s and 1s.

* *7-bit*
+
Data that is all represented as relatively short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation sequences.
No bytes with decimal values greater than 127 are allowed and neither are NULLs (bytes with decimal value 0).
CR (decimal value 13) and LF (decimal value 10) bytes only occur as part of CRLF line separation sequences.

* *8-bit*
+
Data that is all represented as relatively
short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation
sequences. Bytes with decimal values greater than 127
can be used.  As with "7bit data" CR and LF bytes only occur as part
of CRLF line separation sequences. No NULLs are allowed.

* *Base 64*
+
Need info here.

* *Quoted-Printable*
+
Intended to represent data that largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
the US-ASCII character set.  It encodes the data in such a way that
the resulting bytes are unlikely to be modified by mail transport.
If the data being encoded are mostly US-ASCII text, the encoded form
of the data remains largely readable.  A body that is
entirely in the US-ASCII character set may also be encoded in Quoted-Printable to ensure
the integrity of the data should the message pass through a
character-translating, and/or line-wrapping gateway.

| Message Encryption

| The algorithm used to encrypt “send” messages. +


Required?::
Yes

Valid values::

** _3DES

** AES128

** AES192

** AES256

** AES256_WRAP

** IDEA

** MD5

** None

** RC2_CBC

** SHA1

** SHA224

** SHA256

** SHA384

** SHA512


Default::

None


| Message Signature Encryption

| If a partner would like a signature associated with an encrypted message they receive, they can also choose to have the signature encrypted. This field indicates the algorithm the user can select to encrypt the signature. +


Required?::
Yes

Valid values::

** _3DES

** AES128

** AES192

** AES256

** AES256_WRAP

** IDEA

** MD5

** None

** RC2_CBC

** SHA1

** SHA224

** SHA256

** SHA384

** SHA512


Default::

None



|Compress Message after signing and/or encryption

| Indicates if the trading partner wants to see the incoming message and associated signature in compressed form. Zlib is used for compression. +

|Request MDN

|Indicates if the sending partner would like the receiving partner to send a "receipt" (disposition notification) back for every message sent. +

Required::
Yes

Default::
Off

|Request Asynchronous MDN

|Your Partner generates and sends the MDN back to you in a newly initiated path that you had setup at your end. +

Required::
Yes

Default::
Off


| Asynchronous MDN URL

| The URL where the partner sends the MDN. +

Required::
Yes, only if “Request Asynchronous MDN” is on.

Default::
Not Applicable


|MDN Response Wait Time

|The maximum time within which the sender expects to receive an MDN. The value of this field is in seconds. +

Required::
No

Valid values::
Alphanumeric

Default::
60
