== AS2 Receive Settings

[%header,cols="3s,7a"]
|===
|Setting |Description

|Endpoint Name
|Name used to easily identity the function of this endpoint. +
Required: Yes +

|Description
|Describe a purpose and any other important details for this endpoint. +
Required: No +

| AS2 URL (Automatically generated at time of deployment)
| The HTTP(S) address at which your partner is accepting incoming AS2 messages.
The hostname here is dependent upon how it was set up in Mule Runtime.
The port is automatically generated when you deploy a message flow that uses this endpoint.
You'll be able to see it by selecting an AS receive endpoint from your deployed message flow.
Get the hostname from your administrator who created it upon setup.
This derived URL is what you tell your partner where you receive AS2 transmissions from them. +
Required: No +
Default: Yes, if AS2 is the transport protocol +
Required:
Yes

| Message Signature Encryption
| If a partner would like a signature associated with an encrypted message they receive, they can also choose to have the signature encrypted.
This field indicates the algorithm the user can select to encrypt the signature. +

Options are: +

`MD5` +

`SHA1` +

`SHA224` +

`SHA256` +

`SHA384` +

`SHA512` +

Required: Yes +

| Encryption Algorithm
| The preferred algorithm receives encrypted messages. +

Valid values::
`3DES` +
`AES128` +
`AES192` +
`AES256` +
`AES256_WRAP` +
`CAST5`
`IDEA` +
`RC2_CBC` +

Required: Yes +

| Message Subject
| Specifies a default subject for messages you send to this partner +

Required: Yes +

| Encoding
| Type of encoding to use with AS2. +

Options are:

* `*Binary*` +
A method of encoding in which a message is represented using a combination of 0s and 1s.

* `*7-bit*`
+
Data that is represented as relatively short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation sequences.
No bytes with decimal values greater than 127 are allowed and neither are NULLs (bytes with decimal value 0).
CR (decimal value 13) and LF (decimal value 10) bytes only occur as part of CRLF line separation sequences.

* `*8-bit*`
+
Data that is represented as relatively
short lines with 998 bytes or less between CRLF line separation
sequences. Bytes with decimal values greater than 127
can be used.  As with "7bit data" CR and LF bytes only occur as part
of CRLF line separation sequences. No NULLs are allowed.

* `*Base 64*`
+
Encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format to carry data across channels that only reliably support text content.
It is used to embed image files or other binary assets inside textual assets such as HTML and CSS files.

* `*Quoted Printable*`
+
Intended to represent data that largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
the US-ASCII character set.  It encodes the data in such a way that
the resulting bytes are unlikely to be modified by mail transport.
If the data being encoded are mostly US-ASCII text, the encoded form
of the data remains largely readable.  A body that is
entirely in the US-ASCII character set may also be encoded in Quoted-Printable to ensure
the integrity of the data should the message pass through a
character-translating, and/or line-wrapping gateway.
Required: Yes +

| Compress
| Indicates if the trading partner wants to see the incoming message and associated signature in compressed form.
Zlib is used for compression. +
Required: Yes +

|MDN Response Wait Time
|The maximum time within which the sender expects to receive an MDN. The value of this field is in seconds. +
Default: 60 +

| Partner from email
|The Sending partner’s email +
Required: Yes +

| Partner to email
|The Receiving partner’s email +
Required: Yes +
