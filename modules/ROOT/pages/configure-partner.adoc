The only information you need to create a new trading partner is the name and a single identifier related to that partner.
You can add other information later.
Once created, each partner has its own page and shows up in the 'Partners' tab in the left navigation menu.

From the Partners page you can:

* Add information about your trading partners along with contact details.

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify them from one another.

* Add certificates owned by your trading partner.

* Configure validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings applicable to all message flows for this trading partner.
