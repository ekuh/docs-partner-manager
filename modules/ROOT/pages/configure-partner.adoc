The only information you need to create a new trading partner is the name and a single identifier.
You can add other information later.
Once created, each partner has its own page and shows up in the Partners list in the left-hand navigation.

From the Partner page you can:

* Add B2B identifiers to uniquely identify your trading partners.
* Add certificates owned by your partner.
* Configure global validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings.

== Configure a Partner

. Open Partner Manager.
. From within your Partner Manager environment, select the name of your organization from the left-hand navigation.
. Click the *New Partner* button and select an Identifier from the *Type* drop-down menu. This uniquely identifies you as a trading partner. For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: AS2, X12 ISA, X12 GS, or the DUNS number.
. Click *Create Partner* to create your trading partner.
+
* To find a partner, search the Partners list by name, and select the name of the partner.

You can add the following information for each trading partner from the *Partners* selection in the left-hand navigation:

* About (usually the name of the company).

* Your partner's digital certificate (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol).

* Change any global validation settings if you need to override a default value for a particular partner.

Refer to the X12 Settings to change any of the default settings for all X12 received messages.

When you are ready, you can Configure Message Flows.
