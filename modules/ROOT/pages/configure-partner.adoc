The only information you need to create a new trading partner is the name and a single identifier related to that partner.
You can add other information later.
Once created, each partner has its own page and shows up in the *Partners* section in the left navigation menu.

From the Partners page you can:

* Add information about your trading partners along with contact details.

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify them from one another.

* Add certificates owned by your trading partner.

* Configure validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings applicable to all message flows for this trading partner.
