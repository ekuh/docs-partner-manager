The only information you need to create a new trading partner is the name and a single identifier.
You can add other information later.
Once created, each partner has its own page and shows up in the 'Partners' tab in the left-hand navigation menu.

From the Partners page you can:

* Add information about your trading partners along with contact details.

* Add identifiers to uniquely identify them from one another.

* Add certificates owned by your partner.

* Configure global validation, acknowledgement, control number, and character set settings.

== Configure a Trading Partner

. Open Anypoint Partner Manager.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment, select the Partners from the left-hand navigation.

. Click the *New Partner* button and proceed to:
- Add your trating partners name, and
- Select an Identifier from the *Type* drop-down menu. This uniquely identifies you as a trading partner. For example, depending on your setup, select one of the following: AS2, X12 ISA, X12 GS, or the DUNS number.

. Click *Create Partner* to create your trading partner.

You can add the following information for each trading partner from the *Partners* selection in the left-hand navigation:

* About (usually the name of the company).

* Your partner's digital certificate (such as an X.509 certificate in PKCS12 file format for the AS2 transport protocol).

* Change any global validation settings if you need to override a default value for a particular partner.

* To find a partner, search the Partners list by name, and select the name of the partner.

Refer to the X12 Settings to change any of the default settings for all X12 received messages.

When you are ready, you can Configure Message Flows.
