Partner Manager message flows are initially deployed by default to the CloudHub region specified in the default
settings of Access Manager's business group. Subsequent deployments are deployed to the same region as the first deployment.

To access the default deployment settings for your organization, navigate to *Access Management > Partner Manager*.

You can configure the following Partner Manager Settings for CloudHub deployment.

* Runtime version

The default and recommended option is `Use latest version`, which deploys Partner Manager new message flows on the latest Mule runtime version.
If you want the applications deployed to another version, choose it from the menu.

* CloudHub region

The default option is retrieved from the business groupâ€™s default region setting for Runtime Manager in Access Manager.
If you want the B2B integration flows from Partner Manager to be deployed to a different region,
select it from the drop-down menu prior to deploying your first message flow.
Subsequent deployments get deployed to the same region as the first deployment.
To change the default region moving forward, you must undeploy and redeploy all the previously deployed message flows.
For more information refer to xref:configure-message-flows.adoc[Configure Message Flows].

* Anypoint MQ region

This is automatically chosen based on the CloudHub region and cannot be changed.

* Automatically restart app when not responding

If your system allows, you can set this to restart Partner Manager if it does not respond.
For more information, refer to https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/worker-monitoring#enable-automatic-restarts[Enable Automatic Restarts].

* vCore Settings

Configure these at the Sandbox or Production environment level.
The `Document Processing` and `API Replication` Services are core components of the Partner Manager workflow,
requiring a minimum of 1 vCore each. Each unique trading partner and internal endpoints get deployed to isolated workers - requiring a minimum of 0.1 vCore each.
If you require assistance with sizing, please contact your Account representative.
