= Create a Map For XML or JSON to Outbound EDI X12

Follow these steps to create the DataWeave map to transform your application message formats such as XML or JSON to outbound EDI X12 transactions:

. Launch Anypoint Studio.
. From the Anypoint Studio *File* menu, select *New > Project from Template*.
. Log in to Anypoint Exchange with your Anypoint platform credentials.
. Search for `X12`.
. Click the template named `Template to map application messages to outbound EDI X12 transactions`.
. Click *Open*, to create a new project in your Studio workspace pre-loaded with the template. 

== Set the Source Message Type

To set the source JSON or XML message type for the map:

. Copy the schema file of your target application message type into the `src/main/resources` folder in the template project.
. From the *Mule Palette* view, click the *Transform Message* component and drag it on to the Studio canvas.
. Select the *Transform Message* component and in the input section, next to *Payload*, click *Define metadata*.

+
. Click *Add*.
. In *Type id*, enter a new message type ID, for example: `enterprise-outbound-purchase-order`.
. Click *Create type*.
. In the *Select metadata type* dialog window, from the *Type* drop-down menu, select *JSON* or *XML*. 
. Browse to the location of the JSON or XML schema file you imported earlier and click *Select*.

== Set the Target X12 Message Type

The template has the X12 configuration for the below X12 transaction set:

* Version +
`4010`
* Transaction Set + 
`850 (Purchase order)`

Follow these steps to set the target X12 message type:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the Studio canvas in `global-configs.xml`.
. From *Global Configuration Elements*, select *X12 EDO Config* and click *Edit*.
. In *Name*, change the name of the configuration.
. In the *Schema definitions*, select *Edit inline*. 
. Select the value */x12/004010/850.esl* and click the edit icon.
+

+
. Change the Schema value to the version and transaction set you want to map from, for example, set the value to `/x12/004010/204.esl`, if you want to map to a 4010-204 Load tender transaction. +
You now see your application message structure (JSON or XML) on the input pane in the left, and the X12 transaction set structure on the output pane in the right.
. Click *Finish*, then click *OK*. +
You can now begin mapping from input to the output.

You can download a sample project from Exchange that has prebuilt mapping to transform outbound purchase order messages from XML to 4010 850 transactions.

== Test the Map Locally

Follow these steps to test the map locally in Anypoint Studio: 

. Right-click on the project, and click *Run > Run as Mule application*.
. Use a REST client to POST a JSON or an XML payload to the URL `+http://localhost:8081/x12/out+`. +
The application returns the translated EDI X12 transaction.
. Copy the DataWeave map from `src/main/resources/x12/OUT-application-message-to-X12-version-transaction-partner.dwl` and rename it to something meaninfgul, for example: +
`OUT-SAP-purchaseorder-XML-to-X12-4010-850-MythicalSupplier.dwl`

Later, when you create and configure an outbound message flow, you can import the `dwl` file in to the *Map* section of outbound message flow.
