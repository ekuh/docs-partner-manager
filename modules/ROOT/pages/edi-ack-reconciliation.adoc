= EDI Acknowledgment Reconciliation

Partner Manager automatically updates the acknowledgement status of outbound EDI messages you send to your trading partners, as your trading partners return 997 functional acknowledgement transactions.

If you are expecting to receive functional acknowledgements back from your trading partner, you must configure the acknowledgement settings when creating the outbound message flow. 

When your organization receives the functional acknowledgement (X12 997) back from the trading partner, the status of the corresponding outbound transaction is updated as follows:

* The status is updated to `Accepted` if the 997 indicates the acceptance of the transaction by the trading partner.
* The status is updated to `Rejected` if the 997 indicates a rejection.
* When the functional acknowledgement is not received within the time period specified in the message flow’s acknowledgement configuration, Partner Manager marks the outbound transaction’s acknowledgement status as `Overdue`.

The following are examples of the actions your operations team might take while troubleshooting acknowledgement issues: 

* Contacting your trading partner asking them to confirm the receipt of the outbound transaction when reviewing overdue transactions
* Retriggering the transaction from the backend system when reviewing rejected transactions due to missing data elements

. Enter a review comment, indicating the action taken on the transaction’s acknowledgement status and click *Mark reviewed*.
. Optionally, you can download the 997 payload by clicking the *Download* button.

After an overdue or rejected transaction is marked as reviewed, it is no longer displayed in the transaction *Activity* page when you search for transactions with the acknowledgment status of `Overdue` or `Rejected`. You see only the transactions that are not reviewed by your operations team.
