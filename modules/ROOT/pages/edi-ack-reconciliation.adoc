  = EDI Acknowledgment Reconciliation

As your trading partners acknowledge your messages, Partner Manager automatically and updates their acknowledgement status. If you want to be notified, you must specifically configure acknowledgment settings when you create the message.

If you are expecting to receive functional acknowledgements from your trading partners, you must xref:x12-send-settings.adoc[configure the acknowledgement settings] when creating the outbound message flow.

When your organization receives the functional acknowledgement (X12 997) from the trading partner, the status of the corresponding outbound transaction is updated as follows:

* The status is updated to `Accepted` if the 997 indicates the acceptance of the transaction by the trading partner.
* The status is updated to `Rejected` if the 997 indicates a rejection.
* The status is updated to `Overdue` if the the functional acknowledgement is not received within the  time period specified in the message flow’s acknowledgement configuration.

The following are examples of the actions your operations team might take while troubleshooting acknowledgement issues:

* Retriggering the transaction from the backend system when reviewing rejected transactions due to missing data elements
* Asking your trading partner to confirm the receipt of the outbound transaction when reviewing overdue transactions

. Enter a review comment, indicating the action taken on the transaction’s acknowledgement status and click *Mark reviewed*.
. Optionally, you can download the 997 payload by clicking the *Download* button.

After an overdue or rejected transaction is marked as reviewed, it is no longer displayed in the transaction *Activity* page when you search for transactions with the acknowledgment status of `Overdue` or `Rejected`. You see only the transactions that are not reviewed by your operations team.
