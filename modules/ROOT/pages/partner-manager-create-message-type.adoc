== Create and Configure Message Types

Message types define the schematic structure of the transactions received or sent by Partner Manager. 

A message type in Partner Manager can be used in one of the following ways:

* Receive from partners
* Target at host
* Source at host
* Send to partners

Message types are always managed within the host partner profile page, regardless of whether they are used specifically for a single partner or across multiple trading partners. Message types are reusable across message flows for different trading partners.

Create message types from the Host page or from the message flow configuration wizard. When you create message types during message flow configuration, Partner Manager automatically designates the usage for the message type.

== Create a Message Type

. In Partner Manager left navigation, select *<host-name>*. 
. From the *Message types* section host page:
. Click *New*.
. In the *Usage* drop-down list, select the message type use:
* <<receive-and-send-to-partners,*Receive from Partners*>>
* <<target-at-host,*Target at host*>>
* <<source-at-host,*Source at host*>>
* <<receive-and-send-to-partners,*Send to partners*>>
+
If you create a message type from the message flow, Partner Manager automatically designates the *Usage* value. 
. Configure the message type according to the usage you selected.
. Click *Save*. +
The message type appears in the *Message types* section on the host page.

== Receive From and Send To Partners

These are inbound transactions that are received from your trading partners or outbound transactions your organization sends to your trading partners, typically following EDI standards such as X12.

Use the following settings to define X12 as an inbound or outbound message type:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description |Default | Required
|Format | Format of the message, which is `X12`. |`X12`|Yes
|Version | Select a version from the drop-down list. Valid values include: `3010`, `3020`, `3030`, `3040`, `3050`, `3060`, `3070`, `4010`, `4020`, `4030`, `4040`, `4050`, `4060`, `5010`, `5020`, `5030`, `5040`, `5050`, `6020`, `6030`, `6040`, `6050`, `7010`, `7020`, `7030`, `7040`, `7050`
 | None |Yes
|Message Type |This is the X12 transaction set number, such as `850` for Purchase Order or `214` for Shipment Status. |None | Yes
|Schema a| Options include: 

* *Use standard X12-<version>* +
Applies the standard X12 schema for the version and message type configured
* *Customize* +
Allows you to import a customized xref:connectors::x12-edi/x12-edi-schema-language-reference.adoc[EDI schema language] file, if your requirement is to make adjustments to the standard X12 schema. 

When using customized EDI schema, you can assign a custom name to the message type definition, for example, `X12-7050-204-PartnerName`.

[NOTE]
Only segment level customization is supported.
| None |Yes
|===

[[target-at-host]]
== Target at Host

These are application message structure (JSON or XML) to which inbound EDI transactions are translated into and sent to your back-end applications.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description |Default | Required
|Format a|Select a format from the drop-down list:

* *XML* 
* *JSON* |None |Yes
|Schema |Import the XSD or JSON schema file for the message type. |None |Yes
|Name |Partner Manager automatically generates a message type name from the schema file name. You can override it if you need to. |None |Yes
|===

[[source-at-host]]
== Source at Host 

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description |Default | Required
|Format a|Select a value from the drop-down list:

* *XML*
* *JSON* |None |Yes
|Schema |Import the XSD or JSON schema file for the message type. |None |Yes
|Message type identifier a|Partner Manager automatically generates a message type identifier from the schema file name, which you can change. 

The message identifier value is used in the dynamic message routing for outbound B2B transactions. 

See xref:outbound-message-routing.adoc[Outbound Message Routing] to understand how this routing is performed and how your backend applications should pass the message type identifier when sending application messages to Partner Manager endpoints. |None |Yes

|Reference identifiers and business key mapping |Upload a DataWeave script with mapping to extract the <<reference-ids-example,reference identifiers>> and business key mappings from the payload received from the backend application for dynamic routing into the appropriate message flow. |None |Yes
|===

[[reference-ids-example]]
== Reference Identifiers and Business Key Mapping Example

The input to the DataWeave map is the payload that follows the schema uploaded in the message type definition. The output must contain the following fields:

* `partnerReferenceId` +
Required identifier that uniquely identifies the receiving partner
* `hostReferenceId` + 
Optional, except when backend systems are sending outbound transactions on behalf of different internal business units that require different mapping or sender identifiers to be set on the EDI data
* `businessDocumentKey` +
Optional key reference value, such as `Order Number`, `Invoice Number`, and so on

This is an example DataWeave map for an XML payload from the backend application:

[source,DataWeave,linenums]
----
%dw 2.0
output application/json
ns ns0 http://xmlns.mulesoft.com/enterpriseobjects/finance/purchaseorder/

{
	partnerReferenceId: payload.ns0#PurchaseOrder.ns0#VendorName,
	hostReferenceId: payload.ns0#PurchaseOrder.ns0#LineOfBusiness,
	businessDocumentKey: payload.ns0#PurchaseOrder.ns0#PONumber
}

Generated output:

{
"partnerReferenceId": "MYTHICAL SUPPLIER, LLC",
"hostReferenceId": "NTO Retail Canada",
"businessdocumentKey": "INVOICE-005"
}
