= X12 Settings - Receive from Partner

Partner Manager enables you to configure the X12 acknowledgments, validation rules, character encoding, and control numbers to apply when receiving an inbound X12 transmission.

== Configure the Receive Settings

. In the left navigation menu, select the partner for whom to configure the send settings. 
. In the *Validation and acknowledgment settings* section, under *Send to <partner-name>*, click *X12*.
. In the menu on the left, select the setting to configure:
* <<ack-settings,*Acknowledgments*>>
* <<validation-settings,*Validation*>>
* <<control-numbers,Control Numbers>>
* <<character-set,*Character sets*>>
. Click *Save*. 

[NOTE]
It can take up to five minutes or so for your configuration changes to sync with Mule.

[[ack-settings]]
== Acknowledgment Settings

Use the following settings to configure acknowledgment settings:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description, Values, Default

|Send TA1 for each transmission from <recipient>.
|Provides a Technical Acknowledgment (TA1) to the Interchange sender that reports the status of the processing of an interchange header and trailer by the address receiver.
When the ISA and IEA of the received X12 message are valid, a positive TA1 ACK is sent, regardless of what the status of the other content is.
If not, TA1 ACK with an error code is sent.

The TA1 ACK is sent inside an ISA/IEA envelope. The ISA and IEA are no different than any other interchange.

Default: Disabled

|Send functional acknowledgment when messages fail to route to a message flow
|Provides a functional Acknowledgment (the receipt and syntactical acceptability of a message) with the exchange.
Functional acknowledgment settings are configured for each message flow.
They only apply when there is a failure to route the message to one of the message flows.
There are two types of functional acknowledgments: a 997 and a 999.
Partner Manager allows you to choose either a 997 or a 999 acknowledgment, but not both concurrently.

Default: Disabled +

|997 Requested

|The X12 997 functional acknowledgment reports the status of a received interchange.
It reports all the errors encountered while processing the received document.
As with all X12 transaction sets, the 997 ACK is sent inside a GS/GE envelope.
The ST and SE are no different than any other transaction set.

It is used to:

* acknowledge the receipt of an interchange or functional group.
* accept or reject one or more functional groups or transactions.
* verify and report compliance with the standard.

If an interchange contains multiple groups, then a 997 acknowledgment is returned for each group.
If a group contains multiple transaction sets, then the acknowledgment for that group contains multiple AK2 loops, that is,
one for each transaction set. This is only if the AK2 loops are generated for accepted transaction sets.

Default: Disabled +

|999 Requested
|Replaces the 997 Functional Acknowledgment document for use in Healthcare.
The X12 999 implementation acknowledgment reports:

* standard syntax errors as well as implementation guide errors.
* the status of an in-process functional group for HIPAA transactions.

It follows almost all of the same rules as 997, except that the structure and codes of the acknowledgment contents follow the 999 rules.

Default: Disabled +

[[validation-settings]]
== Validation Settings

Selecting the checkbox (Yes) for any of these options means that all the X12 documents meet this condition criteria and receive a 997 failure message.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description

|Fail document when value length outside allowed range
|If selected, a transaction with values that are too long or too short is rejected. If unselected, the values are used and the transaction is not rejected. In either case, the error is logged and reported in the 997 or 999 acknowledgments.

Required: No +
Default: Selected

|Fail document when invalid character in value
|If selected, a transaction with invalid characters is rejected. If unselected, the characters are either passed through or substituted and the transaction is not rejected. In either case, the error is reported in the 997 or 999 acknowledgments.

Required: No +

Default: Not Selected +

|Fail document if value is repeated too many times
|If selected, a transaction with values that are repeated too many or too few times are rejected. If unselected, the values are accepted and the transaction is not rejected. In either case, the error is reported in the 997 or 999 acknowledgments.

Required: No +
Default: Selected

|Fail document if unknown segments are used
|If selected, a transaction containing any unknown segments is rejected. If unselected, unknown segments are ignored and the transaction is not rejected. In either case, the error is reported in the 997 or 999 acknowledgments.

Required: No +
Default: Selected

|Fail document when segments are out of order
|If selected, a transaction with segments that are out of order is rejected. If unselected, the segment can be reordered the transaction is not rejected. In either case, the error is reported in the 997 or 999 acknowledgments.

Required: No +

Default: Selected

|Fail document when too many repeats of a segment
|A transaction with a segment repeated too many times is rejected. The error is reported in the 997 or 999 acknowledgments.

Required: No +

Default: Selected

|Fail document when unused segments are included
|If selected, a transaction containing segments marked as unused in the schema is rejected. If unselected, the transaction is not rejected and the unused segments are ignored. In either case, the error is reported in the 997 or 999 acknowledgments.

Required: No +

Default: Selected

[[control-numbers]]
=== Control Numbers

Apply validations related to your partners or your use of control numbers within the X12 message.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description

|Requires unique interchange control number (ISA13)
|If selected, Partner Manager records the interchange numbers previously processed and rejects any duplicate interchange numbers from the same partner (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification). If unselected, it allows processing of the received interchange to continue.

Required: No +
Default: Not Selected

|Requires unique group control number (GS06)
|If selected, Partner Manager enforces globally unique Group Control Numbers (GS06) for received functional groups. This configuration requires group numbers to be unique across all interchanges received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).

Required: No +
Default: Not Selected

|Requires unique transaction set control number (ST02)
|If selected, Partner Manager enforces globally unique Transaction Set Control Numbers (ST02) for received transaction sets. This configuration requires transaction set numbers to be unique across all functional groups received from the same partner and application (as determined by the interchange sender and receiver identification, combined with the functional group sender and receiver application codes).

Required: No +
Default: Not Selected
|===

[[character-sets]]
=== Character Sets

Selected character set and encoding options pertaining to your partners and/or your X12 message.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Setting |Description

|Character set
|Characters allowed in string data. If set, invalid characters are replaced by the substitution character.
If no substitution character is set or enabled for receive messages in the parser options, they are rejected as errors.
Either way the invalid characters are logged and are reported in the 997 functional acknowledgments for the receive messages.

Possible values include: `Basic`, `Extended`, `Unrestricted`

Required: Yes +
Default: `Extended`

|Character encoding
|Indicates the character encoding for messages. This character encoding is used for both send and receive messages.

Possible values include: `ASCII`, `ISO8859_1`, `UTF-8`

Required: No +
Default: Not Selected
