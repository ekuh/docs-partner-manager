= X12 Global Settings - Receive from Partners
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Refer to these as you set up your X12 settings to receive messages from your partners.
There are two levels of settings, global and partner:
* Global level settings control all X12 messages received from all partners.
* Partner level settings are optionally configured for each partner and override global settings.

== Validation Settings

Any of these options indicated by a checked box (yes) setting means that all of the X12 documents meet this condition criteria and receive a 997 failure message.
