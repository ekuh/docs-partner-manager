= Anypoint Partner Manager

Anypoint Partner Manager enables Business-to-Business (B2B) message exchanges using APIs and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) formats.

Anypoint Partner Manager enables enterprises to conduct business transactions, such as purchasing products from one another.
Transactions are typically transmitted over transports such as HTTPS and SFTP, and exchanges such as AS2. Partner Manager supports X12, JSON, and XML message formats. 

Use Anypoint Partner Manager to:

* Perform technical onboarding of your partners.
* Set up, manage, and monitor business message flows between your systems and your trading partners' systems. +
Track and report on business transactions to achieve greater operational efficiency in B2B transactions.
* View meta information, validation errors, and all messages included with each transmission payload. +
A transmission is a single communication event during which a payload is transferred between two business entities.
These payloads can contain one or more business messages.

Different users with different roles in your organization can use Partner Manager, for example, those who:

* Primarily design and test message flows
