= Cannot process B2B transactions successfully

ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You are performing tests on the flow or when your partner sends you B2B messages and you determine that the transactions are not getting processed.

== Causes

Any of the following can lead to this type of error:
* Your payload storage is not setup correctly or it may not be functioning properly.

If the payload storage is not functional, B2B messages are not processed.

* The message flow configuration may not be aligned to the message being received from the partner.

Examples of incorrect message flow configuration include - incorrect or missing identifiers, incorrect message types, and so forth.

* Your Mule runtimes servers that process your B2B integration workloads may not be functioning properly.

This can happen because your servers may be inactive, the apps may not be functioning correctly, and so forth.

== Solutions

=== Verify Payload Storage

Verify the appropriate configuration for the payload storage API.

* If the payload storage app is functioning, verify the storage source (the S3 bucket, or Azure Blob store, or database, and so on)
that you may be using as the storage solution. Ensure that this solution is up and functioning.

* To view if the payload storage API is active/functioning, open Anypoint Runtime Manager to verify if the related payload storage app is active.
** Try restarting the app.
** Test out your payload storage APIâ€™s configuration using a browser extension such as Postman on Google Chrome.

=== Verify Flow configurations

Verify your message flow configuration to ensure it matches the configuration per your partner.

. From within your Anypoint Partner Manager environment (either Sandbox or Production) select your <Hostname> profile.
. Select *Message Flows*.
. Search for your message flow by the partner name or the message type such as 850.
. Once you locate the message flow, click on the message flow card to open it up.
. From the Message flow configurator, verify the following information per your agreement with your trading partner:

** The correct identifiers are associated with the trading partner.

** The appropriate receive endpoint is configured in the flow.

** The appropriate document type (such as X12, version - 4010, message type - 850) is configured.

** Verify that you have the appropriate acknowledgment configuration.

** Verify that you have an appropriate DataWeave map in the transformation section.

** Verify that you have configured an appropriate target such as both the message type of the target and the associated endpoint configuration.

+

. If all of these look good, then ensure that the last deployment for this flow was successful by viewing the latest deployment history on the right side of the flow.

. If you observe a Failed status, try to deploy the message flow to ensure all your configurations have persisted on the Mule runtime apps.

NOTE: It can take a maximum interval of 5 minutes for your most recent changes to be effective on the runtime B2B Mule apps.

=== Verify B2B integration apps

Verify that your B2B integration apps are active.

. From the Anypoint platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and *Applications*.

. Verify that the B2B apps on the Mule Runtime are active by looking for a status of `started`. The list of apps includes:

** APIReplicationService

** DocumentProcessingService

** One or more inbound apps. The names of these apps are prefaced with inbound-

** One or more outbound apps. The names of these apps are prefaced with outbound-

** There may be one or more acknowledgment apps. The names of these apps are prefaced with ack-

+

. If any of the B2B integration apps do not have a started status, from the Anypoint platform, select Anypoint Runtime Manager and *Applications*.

. For each app that does not have started status, select its row in the table and select *Restart* from the drop-down menu in the upper right of the status area in the information panel.

. If restarting the app does not help you recover the application, select its row in the table and select *Delete* from the drop-down menu in the upper right of the status area in the information panel and confirm the deletion.

. Navigate back to the message flow related to the app you just deleted and deploy the message flow.

Consider the following when performing a delete:

** If you delete the `DocumentProcessingService` or the `APIReplicationService`, deploying any flow results in the redeployment of those apps.

** If you delete any of the inbound and/or outbound and/or ack apps, you have to redeploy the specific flow corresponding to the deleted apps.

If you can't access the Support Portal, contact your Customer Success Manager or MuleSoft Account Management team for assistance.
