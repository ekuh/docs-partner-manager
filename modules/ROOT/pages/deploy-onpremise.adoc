Prior to deploying any message flows from Partner Manager, you need to install and set up Mule runtime engine on-premises and register it on Anypoint Runtime Manager in the appropriate environment.

Install Mule Runtime and Set up a Server Group for Partner Manager

You need to do the following deploy On-Premises from Anypoint Runtime Manager.

. In the appropriate environment within your Anypoint Platform account, create a server group in the Runtime agent and name it: *B2BServerGroup*.

+
All B2B processing Mule apps are deployed to this server group. The steps to set up your server group are in Runtime manager https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/server-group-create[Create a Server Group (Hybrid)].
The server group you set up must use the exact name: *B2BServerGroup*. This name is case sensitive.
+
. Set up your Mule instance by using https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.2/runtime-installation-task[Download and Install Mule] and unzipping it. Partner Manager supports Mule runtime 4.2 or later.

. Add the parameters mentioned in the following `wrapper.conf` file. Youâ€™ll need to adjust the memory and heap size configuration numbers indicated in the following parameters for your environment. The `wrapper.conf` file is located at $MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf. From there you can locate the `wrapper.conf` user conf directory.
+
These are example values. If you are unsure about the Mule capacity you need to handle your B2B transactions, please contact your MuleSoft account representative for assistance.
