= Payload Storage API for Partner Manager

Anypoint Partner Manager enables you to configure your own storage solution, such as database, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and so on to store transmission content, such as incoming and outgoing B2B message payloads.  

Before you create your first trading partner and message flow, you must configure your Payload Storage API within the Host organization in Partner Manager.

To store your content, you must implement an API that provides Anypoint Partner Manager with a standardized way to connect to your unique storage.

== Download and Deploy the Payload Storage API 

Follow these steps to set up the Payload Storage API:

. Implement the API to connect with your choice of storage location (S3, Database, File System, and so on).

. Deploy the API on a runtime that can access the storage solution.

. Make a note of the API URL and configuration values:
* Host, port, and path connection
* Connection Idle and Response timeouts
* Authentication types:
