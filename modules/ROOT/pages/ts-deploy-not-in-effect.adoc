Your runtime B2B Mule apps receive the latest configuration from the Anypoint Partner Manager control plane at a 5 minute interval.
Depending on when you made the configuration changes to your message flows in Partner Manager and deployed them, it can take a maximum interval of 5 minutes for your most recent changes to be effective on the runtime B2B Mule apps.
