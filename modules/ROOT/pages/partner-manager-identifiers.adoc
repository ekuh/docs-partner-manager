= Identifiers

Identifiers are used to identify the sender and receiver partners that are involved in a B2B transaction. For X12 messages, the identifiers in the ISA and GS headers provide valuable information that enables identification of the appropriate flow to use to process the transaction.

== Add and Configure a New Identifier

. In Partner Manager, select the name of your host organization in the left navigation menu. 
. In the *Identifiers* section, click *New*. 
. In the *New Identifier* dialog, select the identifier type from the drop-down list:
* <<as2-identifier,*AS2 Identity*>>
* <<reference-id,*Reference ID*>>
* <<x12-gs,*X12 - GS*>>
* <<x12-isa,*X12 - ISA*>>
. In *Identifier Value*, enter a value to uniquely identify your identifier. 
. If you selected *X12-ISA* as the *Type* value, you must also select a *Qualifier* from the list. 
. Click *Create identifier*.

[[reference-id]]
== Partner Reference Identifiers

The Partner Reference ID is used in outbound message flows that translate your backend application messages to EDI format and then send the data to your trading partners. 

Unlike EDI transactions that have well-defined standards defining how sender, receiver, and document type information is presented on the data, the source messages for outbound B2B data exchange originating from your enterprise backend systems typically follow schemas. These schemas are usually defined by your backend application teams according to your organizationâ€™s data models. 

The receiving trading partner information on the application message from the backend system might not necessarily be the same as the name of the partner in Partner Manager. This is similar to how ISA and GS identifiers on an inbound EDI message might not be the same as the profile name of the partner.
